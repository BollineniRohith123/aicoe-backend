Technical Architecture\n\n### System Components and Interactions\n- **Frontend (React Client):** A single-page application (SPA) responsible for the user interface. It will communicate with the backend via a REST API for authentication and profile management, and via WebSockets for real-time messaging.\n- **Backend API Gateway (Node.js):** An Express.js server that handles HTTP requests for user authentication, profile management, and file uploads. It will also manage the initial WebSocket handshake.\n- **Real-time Messaging Server (Node.js + Socket.io):** A dedicated server (or cluster of servers) to manage WebSocket connections, message routing, and broadcasting. It will be horizontally scalable.\n- **Database (PostgreSQL):** A relational database to store user data, chat metadata, and message history. It will be optimized for read-heavy workloads.\n- **Cache (Redis):** An in-memory data store used for managing session tokens, real-time user presence, and offline message queues.\n- **File Storage (AWS S3 / compatible):** A secure object storage service for storing shared files.\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Frontend:** React, Redux (for state management), Socket.io-client.\n- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io.\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL.\n- **Caching:** Redis.\n- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes (for orchestration), Nginx (as a reverse proxy/load balancer).\n\n### Data Flow and Storage\n1. **Authentication:** User sends credentials to the API Gateway over HTTPS. The API validates against PostgreSQL, creates a session in Redis, and returns a token.\n2. **Real-time Messaging:** The React client establishes a WebSocket connection to the Messaging Server. Messages are sent, encrypted, broadcasted to relevant rooms, and then persisted to PostgreSQL.\n3. **Offline Queue:** When a user disconnects, messages destined for them are stored in a Redis list. Upon reconnection, the server drains this queue and delivers the messages.\n4. **File Sharing:** The client uploads a file to the API Gateway, which streams it directly to S3. A metadata record with the S3 object key is stored in PostgreSQL and a message with a link is sent via WebSocket.\n\n### Deployment Architecture\nThe system will be deployed in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP) using a containerized approach.\n- **Load Balancer:** A public-facing load balancer will distribute traffic across multiple instances of the API Gateway and Messaging Servers.\n- **Auto-scaling:** Auto-scaling groups will be configured for the Messaging Servers to handle fluctuations in concurrent user load.\n- **Database:** A managed PostgreSQL service with read replicas will be used to handle database load.\n- **CI/CD:** A continuous integration and deployment pipeline will automate testing and deployment.\n\n## 10. Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Authentication\n- **AC-01:** Given a user with valid credentials, when they log in, then they are redirected to the chat interface with an active session.\n- **AC-02:** Given a user with invalid credentials, when they attempt to log in, then they see an error message and are not granted access.\n- **AC-03:** Given any request to the server, when it is not over HTTPS, then the server rejects the connection.\n\n### Real-time Messaging\n- **AC-04:** Given two online users in a chat, when one sends a message, then the other receives it within 100ms.\n- **AC-05:** Given a sent message, when it is stored in the database, then it is encrypted.\n- **AC-06:** Given a message containing script tags, when it is sent, then the script is sanitized and not executed on the recipient's client.\n\n### Offline Support\n- **AC-07:** Given a user who goes offline, when a message is sent to them, then it is added to their queue.\n- **AC-08:** Given a user with queued messages, when they come back online, then all queued messages are delivered in order.\n\n### Group Chat\n- **AC-09:** Given a user, when they create a group with a unique name and add members, then the group is created and members receive invitations.\n- **AC-10:** Given a user in a group, when a message is sent to the group, then all online members receive the message.\n\n### File Sharing\n- **AC-11:** Given a user who selects a valid file under the size limit, when they share it, then a downloadable link is sent in the chat.\n- **AC-12:** Given a user who selects an invalid file type, when they try to share it, then an error is shown and the file is not uploaded.\n\n### Search\n- **AC-13:** Given a user with chat history, when they search for a keyword present in a message, then the relevant message is returned in the results in under 2 seconds.\n- **AC-14:** Given a user searching for a keyword in a chat they are not part of, when the search is executed, then no messages from that chat appear in the results.\n\n## 11. Success Metrics\n\n### User Adoption Metrics\n- **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Target 5,000 DAU within 3 months of launch.\n- **User Retention Rate:** Target a 7-day retention rate of 60% for new users.\n- **Messages Sent Per Day:** Target an average of 10 messages sent per active user per day.\n\n### Business Impact Metrics\n- **User Satisfaction Score (CSAT/NPS):** Achieve a score above 4.5/5 in post-beta surveys.\n- **Feature Adoption Rate:** 80% of active users should utilize at least one \"Should-Have\" feature (e.g., group chat, file sharing).\n- **Time to Market:** Beta launch in 6 weeks, full launch in 3 months.\n\n### Technical Performance Metrics\n- **Message Delivery Latency:** 95th percentile latency below 100ms.\n- **System Uptime:** 99.9% availability measured monthly.\n- **Concurrent User Capacity:** Successfully sustain 10,000 concurrent users in a load test.\n- **Error Rate:** Application error rate below 0.1%.\n\n## 12. Timeline & Milestones\n\n### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-4)\n- **Scope:**\n  - Project setup, CI/CD pipeline, and development environment.\n  - User authentication and session management.\n  - Basic one-on-one real-time messaging.\n  - Database schema design and implementation.\n- **Timeline:** 4 weeks.\n- **Milestone:** Internal demo of a functional, authenticated chat between two users.\n\n### Phase 2: Feature Expansion (Weeks 5-8)\n- **Scope:**\n  - Group chat creation and management.\n  - Offline message queuing and delivery.\n  - File sharing capabilities.\n  - Basic UI/UX polish and mobile responsiveness.\n- **Timeline:** 4 weeks.\n- **Milestone:** Beta version release for internal and limited external testing.\n\n### Phase 3: Polish & Launch (Weeks 9-12)\n- **Scope:**\n  - Message search and history functionality.\n  - User presence and typing indicators.\n  - Performance optimization and load testing.\n  - Security audit and penetration testing.\n  - Final UI/UX improvements and bug fixes.\n- **Timeline:** 4 weeks.\n- **Milestone:** Full production launch (v1.0).\n\n## 13. Risks & Mitigation\n\n| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |\n|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Performance bottleneck at 10,000 concurrent users | High | Medium | Implement horizontal scaling with Kubernetes, conduct rigorous load testing early, and use Redis for connection state management. |\n| WebSocket connection stability issues | High | Medium | Implement robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff in the client, and use a message acknowledgment (ACK) system to ensure delivery. |\n| Security vulnerabilities in real-time communication | High | Low | Conduct regular third-party security audits and penetration testing. Implement end-to-end encryption and enforce strict input validation. |\n| Message delivery latency exceeding 100ms | Medium | Medium | Optimize",

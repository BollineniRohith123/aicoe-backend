Non-Functional Requirements\n\n**Performance:**\n- The application must load and become interactive within 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection.\n- All user actions (add, edit, delete, complete, filter) must provide visual feedback within 200 milliseconds.\n- The application must be able to handle a list of up to 1,000 todo items without significant degradation in performance.\n\n**Security:**\n- As a client-side only application, data is stored locally in the browser. The system must ensure no sensitive data is exposed through cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n- All user input must be sanitized to prevent injection attacks.\n\n**Usability:**\n- The user interface must be clean, uncluttered, and intuitive, requiring no documentation for basic use.\n- The application must be fully responsive and usable on screen sizes from 320px (mobile) to 1920px (desktop).\n- The application must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.\n\n**Reliability:**\n- The application must function correctly on the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n- Data stored in the browser's local storage must not be corrupted by application errors.\n- The application must gracefully handle browser storage quota being exceeded.\n\n**Maintainability:**\n- Code must be well-documented, modular, and follow industry-standard best practices.\n- The front-end architecture must allow for easy addition of new features without significant refactoring.\n- A comprehensive style guide must be used to ensure UI consistency.\n\n## 9. Technical Architecture\n\n**System Components and Interactions:**\nThe application will be a Single-Page Application (SPA) composed of three main layers:\n1.  **Presentation Layer (UI):** Built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) to manage the user interface and state. This layer will handle all user interactions and render the todo list and input controls.\n2.  **Business Logic Layer:** This layer, contained within the SPA, will manage the core application logic, including creating, updating, deleting, and filtering todo items.\n3.  **Data Persistence Layer:** The application will use the browser's `localStorage` API to persist todo data on the client's device. This eliminates the need for a backend server and database for the initial version.\n\n**Technology Stack Recommendations:**\n- **Frontend Framework:** React or Vue.js for component-based architecture and efficient state management.\n- **Styling:** CSS Modules or a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS to create a clean, responsive design.\n- **Build Tool:** Vite or Webpack for fast development and optimized production builds.\n- **Language:** TypeScript for improved code quality and maintainability.\n\n**Integration Points and APIs:**\n- No external APIs are required for the core functionality.\n- The only integration point is with the browser's native `localStorage` API.\n\n**Data Flow and Storage:**\n- User actions trigger events in the Presentation Layer.\n- The Business Logic Layer processes these events, updating the in-memory state.\n- The state is then persisted to `localStorage` as a JSON string.\n- On application load, the data is retrieved from `localStorage` to populate the initial state.\n\n**Deployment Architecture:**\n- The application will be deployed as a set of static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or a static hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages). This ensures high availability, scalability, and fast load times globally.\n\n## 10. Acceptance Criteria\n\n**AC-01: Todo Creation**\nGiven the user is on the main page, when they type a task and press Enter, the task appears in the list below the input field, and the input field is cleared.\n\n**AC-02: Empty Todo Rejection**\nGiven the user is on the main page, when they press Enter or click 'Add' with an empty input field, no new item is created, and an error message is shown.\n\n**AC-03: Todo Completion**\nGiven there is an active todo item in the list, when the user clicks its checkbox, the item's text is struck through and its appearance changes to indicate completion.\n\n**AC-04: Todo Un-completion**\nGiven there is a completed todo item in the list, when the user clicks its checkbox again, the strikethrough and completion styling are removed, and it appears as an active item.\n\n**AC-05: Todo Deletion**\nGiven there is a todo item in the list, when the user clicks its delete button and confirms the action, the item is immediately removed from the list.\n\n**AC-06: Todo Editing**\nGiven there is a todo item in the list, when the user double-clicks its text, it becomes an editable field. Upon saving, the new text is displayed.\n\n**AC-07: Filter by Active**\nGiven there are both active and completed todos, when the user clicks the 'Active' filter, only the active todos are displayed.\n\n**AC-08: Filter by Completed**\nGiven there are both active and completed todos, when the user clicks the 'Completed' filter, only the completed todos are displayed.\n\n**AC-09: Data Persistence**\nGiven the user has added todos, when they close and reopen the browser tab, their todo list is restored to its previous state.\n\n**AC-10: Empty List Display**\nGiven the user has no todos, when they load the application, a message encouraging them to add their first todo is displayed.\n\n## 11. Success Metrics\n\n**User Adoption Metrics:**\n- **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Target of 50 DAU within the first month post-launch.\n- **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of created todos that are eventually marked as complete.

Risks & Mitigation\n\n| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |\n|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Scope creep leading to complexity | High | Medium | Strict adherence to the defined feature set. Any new feature requests must be deferred to a future version. Regular scope review meetings with stakeholders. |\n| Poor user experience due to oversimplification | Medium | Medium | Conduct iterative usability testing with target users during development. Gather feedback on the prototype to ensure the app is simple but not frustrating. |\n| Data loss if using only local storage | High | Low | Clearly communicate to users that data is stored locally in the browser. Consider adding an 'Export to File' feature in a future version to allow users to back up their data. |\n| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Utilize a modern JavaScript framework that handles many cross-browser inconsistencies. Perform testing on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge before launch. |\n| Unclear requirements leading to rework | Medium | Low | Maintain open and frequent communication between the Product and Development teams. Use this PRD as the single source of truth and validate assumptions with prototypes. |\n\n## 14. Dependencies & Assumptions\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- **External Systems/APIs:** None. The application is self-contained.\n- **Third-party Services:** A static hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) for deployment.\n- **Team Resources:** Availability of one front-end developer and one product manager for the duration of the 4-week timeline.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- **Technical Assumptions:** Users will have a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) released within the last 2 years. JavaScript will be enabled.\n- **Business Assumptions:** The project does not require user authentication or a multi-user database for the initial version. The primary goal is to validate the core concept and user experience.\n- **User Behavior Assumptions:** Users are familiar with basic web application interactions like clicking buttons, typing in text fields, and using checkboxes. They are looking for a personal, single-user tool.\n\n## 15. Open Questions\n\n1.  **Branding and Visual Identity:** What are the specific brand colors, logos, and typography guidelines to be used for the application?\n2.  **Data Export Priority:** Should an 'Export to File' (e.g., JSON, CSV) feature be considered a \"Should-Have\" instead of a \"Nice-to-Have\" to fully mitigate the data loss risk?\n3.  **Long-Term Roadmap:** Are there any specific features (e.g., due dates, tags) that are being considered for a potential V2, which might influence the current data model structure?\n\n---\n\n**Document Footer:**\n*This PRD was generated by the AICOE Multi-Agent Platform using AI-powered analysis.*\n*For questions or feedback, contact the AICOE Product Team.*\n\n---",

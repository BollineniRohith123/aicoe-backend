Problem Statement\n### What problem are we solving?\nThe manufacturing facility is operating below its potential due to reactive maintenance practices, manual quality control processes, and a lack of real-time data visibility. This leads to significant financial losses from unplanned downtime, high scrap and rework costs, and operational inefficiencies.\n\n### Who has this problem?\nThe problem impacts the entire organization, most critically the Operations Director, Production Managers, Maintenance Supervisors, and Quality Assurance Managers who are responsible for meeting production targets, managing costs, and ensuring product quality.\n\n### Current pain points and limitations\n- **Unplanned Downtime:** 2,400 hours annually, costing $2.8M in lost production.\n- **Low OEE:** At 68%, it is significantly below the 75% industry average.\n- **High Defect Rate:** 8.2% of finished products require costly rework or are scrapped.\n- **Inspection Bottleneck:** Manual inspection is slow (45 mins/batch), creating production delays.\n- **Resource Allocation:** Production lines are underutilized, running at only 60-80% capacity.\n- **Visibility Gaps:** Only 40% of the production floor is covered by sensors, leading to blind spots.\n- **Data Silos:** Critical production, quality, and maintenance data are stored in separate, unintegrated systems.\n\n### Opportunity size and market context\nBy addressing these inefficiencies with AI, the facility can save millions annually, improve its competitive position in the automotive supply chain, and create a scalable model for future digital transformation initiatives across multiple sites.\n\n## 4.

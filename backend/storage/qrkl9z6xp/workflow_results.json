Problem Statement\n\n### What problem are we solving?\nBusinesses today operate in a fast-paced environment where data is generated continuously. However, accessing and interpreting this data in a timely manner is a significant challenge. Teams rely on siloed data sources and manual processes to compile reports, which are often outdated by the time they are reviewed. This creates a decision-making gap, where leaders are reacting to past events rather than responding to current conditions.\n\n### Who has this problem?\n- **Managers:** Need to monitor team performance and operational health but lack a real-time view.\n- **Business Analysts:** Spend excessive time on data extraction and preparation instead of analysis.\n- **Executives:** Require a high-level, consolidated view of business KPIs to inform strategic decisions.\n- **Operational Teams:** Need immediate alerts and visualizations to maintain system health and efficiency.\n\n### Current pain points and limitations\n- **Data Silos:** Critical information is locked away in different databases and applications, making a holistic view difficult.\n- **Manual Reporting:** The process of gathering data from multiple sources and creating reports is time-consuming, error-prone, and infrequent.\n- **Delayed Insights:** By the time data is compiled and presented, the opportunity to act on it may have passed.\n- **Lack of Personalization:** Standard reports do not cater to the specific needs of different roles, leading to information overload or irrelevant data.\n\n### Opportunity size and market context\nThe demand for real-time business intelligence is growing exponentially. Organizations that can leverage live data gain a competitive advantage through increased agility and improved operational efficiency. This project positions AICOE to meet this market need by providing an intuitive, powerful, and accessible analytics tool.\n\n## 4.

Use Cases\n\n### UC-001: View Real-Time Dashboard\n- **Actors:** User, Business Analyst, Manager\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - The user must be authenticated and logged into the system.\n  - At least one dashboard must be configured and available to the user.\n  - Backend data sources must be accessible and operational.\n- **Main Flow:**\n  1. The user navigates to the analytics dashboard URL.\n  2. The system authenticates the user and loads their default dashboard view.\n  3. The system fetches the initial data for all widgets on the dashboard from their respective data sources.\n  4. The system renders the widgets, displaying metrics, KPIs, and charts.\n  5. A WebSocket connection is established between the client and the server for real-time updates.\n  6. As new data points are available, the server pushes updates through the WebSocket.\n  7. The client receives the updates and refreshes the corresponding widget's data visualization.\n- **Alternative Flows:**\n  - **Select a Different Dashboard:** If the user has access to multiple dashboards, they can select a different one from a dropdown menu. The system then loads the selected dashboard's configuration and data.\n  - **WebSocket Connection Fails:** If the WebSocket connection cannot be established or is lost, the system displays a notification indicating the real-time connection is down. The system can fall back to polling for updates every 30-60 seconds and will automatically attempt to re-establish the WebSocket connection.\n  - **No Dashboards Available:** If a new user has no dashboards, the system presents them with an option to create their first dashboard.\n- **Postconditions:**\n  - The user is viewing a dashboard with current data.\n  - The system is actively listening for real-time data updates for the displayed widgets.\n- **Priority:** High\n- **Business Value:** Provides immediate visibility into business performance and operational health, enabling faster, data-driven decision-making and proactive issue detection.\n\n### UC-002: Customize Dashboard Layout\n- **Actors:** User\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - The user must be logged in.\n  - The user must be viewing a dashboard for which they have edit permissions.\n- **Main Flow:**\n  1. The user clicks an 'Edit' or 'Customize' button on the dashboard.\n  2. The dashboard enters an editable state, showing resize handles and a palette of available widget types.\n  3. The user drags a new widget from the palette and drops it onto the dashboard grid.\n  4. The user resizes a widget by dragging its corners.\n  5. The user drags a widget to a new position on the grid.\n  6. The user clicks a 'Save' button to commit the changes.\n- **Alternative Flows:**\n  - **Discard Changes:** The user can click a 'Cancel' or 'Discard' button to exit edit mode without saving any changes.\n  - **Remove a Widget:** In edit mode, the user clicks a 'Remove' or 'X' icon on a widget to delete it from the dashboard.\n  - **Configure a Widget:** The user clicks a 'Configure' icon on a widget to open a settings panel where they can change the data source, metrics displayed, chart type, or other properties.\n- **Postconditions:**\n  - The dashboard's new layout and widget configuration is saved to the user's profile.\n  - The next time the user loads this dashboard, it will appear in its customized state.\n- **Priority:** High\n- **Business Value:** Empowers users to create personalized views that are most relevant to their roles and responsibilities, increasing user adoption, engagement, and the overall utility of the dashboard.\n\n### UC-003: Create and Manage User Dashboards\n- **Actors:** User\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - The user must be logged in.\n- **Main Flow:**\n  1. The user accesses a dashboard management area (e.g., via a 'My Dashboards' menu).\n  2. The user clicks a 'Create New Dashboard' button.\n  3. The system prompts the user to enter a name for the new dashboard.\n  4. The user enters a unique name and confirms.\n  5. The system creates a new, empty dashboard with that name and adds it to the user's list of dashboards.\n- **Alternative Flows:**\n  - **Rename Dashboard:** From the management list, the user selects a dashboard and chooses a 'Rename' option, enters a new name, and saves the change.\n  - **Delete Dashboard:** From the management list, the user selects a dashboard and chooses a 'Delete' option. The system asks for confirmation. Upon confirmation, the dashboard is permanently deleted.\n  - **Set Default Dashboard:** The user selects a dashboard and chooses a 'Set as Default' option. This dashboard will now load automatically upon login.\n- **Postconditions:**\n  - A new dashboard is created and available for customization.\n  - An existing dashboard's name is changed, or it is deleted.\n  - The user's default dashboard setting is updated.\n- **Priority:** Medium\n- **Business Value:** Allows for better organization of analytics by enabling users to build dedicated dashboards for different projects, departments, or business questions, improving clarity and focus.\n\n### UC-004: Export Dashboard Data\n- **Actors:** User\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - The user must be logged in and viewing a dashboard.\n  - The user must have the necessary permissions to export data.\n- **Main Flow:**\n  1. The user clicks an 'Export' button on the dashboard.\n  2. The system presents a modal dialog with export options (e.g., 'Export as PDF', 'Export as CSV', 'Export as Image').\n  3. The user selects the desired export format.\n  4. The user clicks an 'Export' or 'Download' button in the dialog.\n  5. The system generates the file in the selected format.\n  6. The file is downloaded to the user's local machine via the browser.\n- **Alternative Flows:**\n  - **Export Single Widget:** Instead of exporting the whole dashboard, the user clicks an export icon within a specific widget to export only that widget's data or image.\n  - **Export Fails:** If the export process fails (e.g., due to a server error or too much data), the system displays an error message to the user explaining the issue.\n- **Postconditions:**\n  - The user has a file containing the dashboard's data or visualizations in their chosen format.\n- **Priority:** Medium\n- **Business Value:** Facilitates the sharing of insights with stakeholders who may not have direct access to the dashboard and enables integration of real-time data into static reporting and archival processes.\n\n## 7.

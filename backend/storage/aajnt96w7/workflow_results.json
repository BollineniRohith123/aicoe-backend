Executive Summary\nThe Quick Test project aims to develop a simple, intuitive calculator application that provides core arithmetic functionality. This product will serve as a fundamental tool for users requiring quick and accurate mathematical calculations. The application will focus on delivering a clean, user-friendly interface with reliable performance for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The primary business value lies in creating a functional, accessible tool that meets everyday calculation needs while establishing a foundation for potential future enhancements. Key stakeholders include the development team, product management, and end-users seeking a straightforward calculation solution. The project timeline and resource allocation will be defined in subsequent planning phases.\n\n## 2. Goals & Objectives\n**Business goals:**\n- Successfully launch a functional calculator application within the defined development timeline\n- Achieve 100% accuracy for all basic arithmetic operations\n- Establish a baseline product that can be iterated upon for future feature enhancements\n- Create a positive user experience that drives adoption and satisfaction\n\n**User goals:**\n- Perform basic arithmetic calculations quickly and accurately\n- Navigate the calculator interface intuitively without requiring training\n- Receive immediate and clear feedback for all inputs and calculations\n- Correct errors easily through clear and reset functions\n\n**Technical goals:**\n- Develop a stable application with zero crashes during normal operation\n- Ensure sub-second response time for all calculations\n- Implement clean, maintainable code architecture\n- Achieve cross-platform compatibility where applicable\n\n## 3. Problem Statement\n**What problem are we solving?**\nUsers frequently need to perform basic mathematical calculations for personal, academic, or professional tasks. Many existing calculator applications are overly complex, contain distracting features, or are not readily accessible across all devices.

Executive Summary\nThe Task Management App - Retry is a comprehensive software solution designed to empower individuals and teams to efficiently create, organize, and track their work. The project's primary purpose is to address the common challenges of task management, including missed deadlines, disorganized workflows, and lack of team visibility. By providing an intuitive platform for task creation, prioritization, collaboration, and progress monitoring, the application is expected to deliver significant business value by increasing productivity, enhancing team collaboration, and improving project outcomes. Key stakeholders include individual users, team members, and management. The target timeline for the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch is within the next 6 months.\n\n## 2. Goals & Objectives\n### Business Goals\n- Increase individual and team productivity by 25% through improved task organization and visibility.\n- Reduce the number of missed deadlines by 40% through effective due date tracking and notification systems.\n- Enhance team collaboration efficiency by 30% by providing clear task assignment and ownership features.\n- Achieve a user adoption rate of 80% within the first 3 months post-launch.\n- Reduce the time spent in status update meetings by 25% by providing a centralized dashboard for progress tracking.\n\n### User Goals\n- To quickly and easily capture work items as tasks, ensuring nothing is forgotten.\n- To organize and prioritize tasks based on personal or team-defined criteria (lists, tags, priority).\n- To have a clear, real-time view of personal and team task progress and upcoming deadlines.\n- To seamlessly collaborate with team members by assigning tasks and sharing updates.\n- To receive timely and relevant notifications about task-related activities.\n\n### Technical Goals\n- Achieve 99.5% or higher system uptime to ensure reliability.\n- Support up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.\n- Ensure the application is responsive and accessible on both web and mobile platforms.\n- Implement robust security measures to comply with data protection and privacy regulations.\n- Provide offline functionality for core task viewing and creation.\n\n## 3. Problem Statement\n### What problem are we solving?\nIndividuals and teams struggle with managing their workload effectively due to a lack of a centralized, intuitive system for tracking tasks. This leads to disorganization, unclear priorities, missed deadlines, and inefficient collaboration.\n\n### Who has this problem?\nThe problem affects a broad range of professionals, including individual contributors, project managers, team leads, and entire departments within any organization that relies on task-based work.\n\n### Current pain points and limitations\n- **Task Visibility:** Difficulty in getting a clear overview of all tasks, their status, and priorities.\n- **Missed Deadlines:** Lack of proactive reminders and tracking leads to overdue tasks.\n- **Collaboration Gaps:** Unclear ownership of tasks and inefficient communication about progress.\n- **Disorganization:** Tasks are scattered across emails, documents, and mental notes, making them hard to track.\n- **Productivity Loss:** Time is wasted trying to figure out what to work on next instead of doing the work.\n\n### Opportunity size and market context\nThe market for productivity and collaboration software is substantial and growing. By providing a focused, user-friendly task management solution, there is a significant opportunity to capture market share from more complex, enterprise-heavy tools or basic, non-collaborative methods like spreadsheets. The demand for tools that support remote and hybrid work models further amplifies this opportunity.\n\n## 4.

Technical Architecture\n\n### System Components\n- **Frontend (Web & Mobile):** A single-page application (SPA) for the web and a native mobile application. They will handle the user interface and make API calls to the backend.\n- **API Gateway:** A single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, and rate limiting.\n- **Backend Services:** A set of microservices responsible for business logic (e.g., Task Service, User Service, Notification Service).\n- **Database:** A primary relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data like users, tasks, and assignments. A caching layer (e.g., Redis) for session management and frequently accessed data.\n- **Notification Service:** A dedicated service to handle the queuing and delivery of in-app, email, and push notifications.\n\n### Technology Stack Recommendations\n- **Frontend:** React or Vue.js for web; React Native or Swift/Kotlin for mobile.\n- **Backend:** Node.js (Express/NestJS) or Python (Django/FastAPI).\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL.\n- **Cache:** Redis.\n- **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or AWS SQS for asynchronous tasks like sending notifications.\n\n### Integration Points and APIs\n- **Internal APIs:** RESTful APIs for communication between frontend, backend services, and the API gateway.\n- **External APIs:** Potential future integration with calendar APIs (Google Calendar, Outlook) and email services (SendGrid, SES).\n\n### Data Flow and Storage\n- User actions on the frontend are sent as HTTPS requests to the API Gateway.\n- The API Gateway authenticates the request and routes it to the appropriate backend service.\n- Backend services process the request, interact with the database or cache, and return a response.\n- For events like task assignment, the backend service publishes a message to the notification queue, which is then processed by the Notification Service.\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- A containerized architecture using Docker.\n- Orchestrated using Kubernetes.\n- Deployed on a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) with a multi-region setup for high availability.\n- Utilization of a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n\n## 10. Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Task Creation\n- **AC-01:** Given a logged-in user, when they fill in the task title and click 'Create', then a new task is saved and appears in their task list.\n- **AC-02:** Given a user creating a task, when they leave the title field empty and click 'Create', then an inline error message is displayed.\n\n### Task Organization\n- **AC-03:** Given a user with existing tasks, when they drag and drop a task into a new list, then the task is successfully moved and the view is updated.\n- **AC-04:** Given a user viewing their task list, when they apply a filter for a specific tag, then only tasks with that tag are displayed.\n\n### Task Progress Tracking\n- **AC-05:** Given a user viewing a task, when they change the status to 'Completed', then the task is marked as done and moved to a 'Completed' section/view.\n- **AC-06:** Given a task assigned to a user, when they view the task details, they can see a history of all status changes.\n\n### Collaboration\n- **AC-07:** Given a user with assignment permissions, when they assign a task to a team member, then the team member receives an in-app notification and the task appears in their \"Assigned to Me\" list.\n\n### Notifications\n- **AC-08:** Given a task with a due date in 24 hours, when the system checks for due tasks, then the assigned user receives a due date reminder notification.\n\n### Dashboard\n- **AC-09:** Given a user navigating to the dashboard, when the page loads, then they see a summary widget showing the number of tasks for each status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed).\n\n## 11.

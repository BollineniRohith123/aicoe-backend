Risks & Mitigation\n\n| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |\n|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Timeline compression may impact code quality and testing coverage | High | Medium | Prioritize core features, implement automated testing, conduct regular code reviews |\n| Technical challenges with React-Node.js integration may cause delays | Medium | Medium | Use proven patterns from industry best practices, allocate buffer time for technical integration |\n| Budget limitations may restrict feature scope or quality | High | Low | Focus on MVP features, leverage open-source libraries, optimize development efficiency |\n| Cross-browser compatibility issues may affect user experience | Medium | Medium | Implement comprehensive cross-browser testing, use progressive enhancement techniques |\n| Performance issues may affect user adoption | High | Low | Implement performance monitoring, optimize critical rendering paths, use lazy loading |\n\n## 15. Dependencies & Assumptions\n\n### Dependencies\n- **External Systems:** Cloud hosting provider (AWS/Heroku), database service (MongoDB Atlas)\n- **Third-Party Services:** CDN for static asset delivery, monitoring service for application performance\n- **Team Resources:** Frontend developer, backend developer, UX/UI designer, QA tester\n- **Development Tools:** Git repository management, project management tools, communication platforms\n\n### Assumptions\n- **Technical Assumptions:** Users have modern web browsers supporting ES6+ features; Reliable internet connection is available for full functionality\n- **Business Assumptions:** No complex user authentication system is required for initial release; Single user scenario without collaboration features for MVP\n- **User Behavior Assumptions:** Users prefer simple, focused interfaces over complex feature sets; Users will access the application primarily from modern devices\n\n## 16. Open Questions\n- Should we implement user authentication for the initial release or defer to a future version?\n- What is the preferred cloud hosting provider based on cost and performance requirements?\n- Should we implement local storage for offline functionality in the MVP?\n- What is the maximum number of tasks we should support per user to ensure optimal performance?\n- Should we include task editing functionality in the initial release or defer to maintain simplicity?\n\n---\n\n**Document Footer:**\n*This PRD was generated by the AICOE Multi-Agent Platform using AI-powered analysis.*\n*For questions or feedback, contact the AICOE Product Team.*",

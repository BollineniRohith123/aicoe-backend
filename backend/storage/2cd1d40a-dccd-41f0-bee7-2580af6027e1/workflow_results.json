Technical Architecture\n### System Components and Interactions\nThe system will be built on a microservices architecture with the following core components:\n- **Frontend Application:** A React-based Single Page Application (SPA) that renders the user interface.\n- **API Gateway:** A Node.js/Express gateway that routes requests to appropriate backend services and handles authentication.\n- **Dashboard Service:** Manages dashboard CRUD operations, metadata, and user permissions.\n- **Data Ingestion Service:** Connects to various data sources (SQL, MongoDB, APIs), fetches data, and normalizes it.\n- **Real-time Engine:** Uses WebSockets to push data updates to connected clients.\n- **Authentication Service:** Handles user login, session management, and JWT token generation.\n- **Alert Service:** Monitors data against thresholds and triggers notifications.\n- **Export Service:** Generates and handles asynchronous export requests.\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Frontend:** React, D3.js, Chart.js, Redux for state management\n- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js\n- **Real-time Communication:** WebSocket (Socket.io)\n- **Databases:** PostgreSQL (for relational data), Redis (for caching and session management)\n- **Mobile:** Progressive Web App (PWA) with Service Workers\n\n### Integration Points and APIs\n- **Internal APIs:** RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend microservices.\n- **External Data Sources:** Connectors for SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL databases (MongoDB), and REST APIs.\n- **Notification Services:** Integration with company email server (SMTP) for alerts and user management.\n\n### Data Flow and Storage\n1. User actions from the React frontend are sent via HTTPS to the API Gateway.\n2. The API Gateway authenticates the request and routes it to the relevant microservice.\n3. For dashboard data, the Data Ingestion Service queries the source systems (SQL, MongoDB, API).\n4. The Real-time Engine subscribes to data changes and pushes updates to clients via WebSocket.\n5. User data, dashboard metadata, and permissions are stored in PostgreSQL.\n6. Frequently accessed data and session information are cached in Redis for performance.\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Containerization:** All microservices will be containerized using Docker.\n- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes will be used for container orchestration, auto-scaling, and load balancing.\n- **Cloud Infrastructure:** The system will be deployed on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure) with high availability across multiple availability zones.\n- **CI/CD:** A pipeline will be established for automated testing, building, and deployment using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI.\n\n## 10. Acceptance Criteria\n### Dashboard Creation and Customization\n- AC-01: Given a logged-in user with create permissions, when they navigate to the dashboard management page and click \"Create New Dashboard,\" they are presented with options for a blank canvas or a template.\n- AC-02: Given a user is on the dashboard canvas, when they drag a widget from the palette and drop it onto the canvas, the widget is added and rendered in the dropped location.\n- AC-03: Given a user has customized a dashboard, when they click \"Save,\" the dashboard configuration is persisted and they are redirected to view the saved dashboard.\n\n### Real-Time Data Visualization\n- AC-04: Given a user has configured a widget with a data source, when the save is successful, the widget displays a sample of the data within 2 seconds.\n- AC-05: Given a widget is configured for real-time updates, when the refresh interval is met, the widget data updates automatically without a full page refresh.\n- AC-06: Given a user configures a data source with invalid credentials, when they test the connection, the system displays a clear error message indicating the failure reason.\n\n### Export Functionality\n- AC-07: Given a user is viewing a dashboard, when they click \"Export\" and select PDF format, a downloadable PDF file of the dashboard is generated.\n- AC-08: Given a user initiates an export for a large dataset, when the process is complete, they receive an email with a secure download link.\n\n### User Authentication and Access Control\n- AC-09: Given a new user is created by an administrator, when the account is saved, the user receives a welcome email with their login credentials.\n- AC-10: Given a user without edit permissions attempts to modify a dashboard, when they try to enter edit mode, they receive an \"Access Denied\" message.\n\n### Alert System\n- AC-11: Given a user has configured an alert for a KPI widget with a threshold of >1000, when the KPI value exceeds 1000, an email notification is sent to the user.\n- AC-12: Given an alert has been triggered, when the user views the alert history, the alert event is logged with a timestamp and the value that triggered it.\n\n### Mobile Access\n- AC-13: Given a user accesses the dashboard URL on a mobile device, when the page loads, the layout is optimized for the smaller screen size.\n- AC-14: Given a user is using the PWA offline, when they open a previously loaded dashboard, the cached data is displayed.\n\n## 11.

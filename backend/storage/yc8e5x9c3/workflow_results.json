Problem Statement\n\n### What problem are we solving?\nIn an increasingly digital world, individuals and professionals struggle to manage their daily tasks and responsibilities effectively. Many existing solutions are either overly complex with a steep learning curve, part of a larger expensive ecosystem, or too simplistic and lack essential features like filtering and reliable data persistence. This leads to decreased productivity, mental clutter, and a reliance on less efficient methods like paper notes or unstructured digital documents.\n\n### Who has this problem?\nThis problem is universal, affecting students, professionals, freelancers, and anyone looking to organize their personal or work-related activities. Our primary target user is the \"busy professional\" who needs a fast, reliable, and distraction-free tool to manage their workflow.\n\n### Current pain points and limitations\n- **Cognitive Overload:** Feature-heavy applications like some competitors can distract users from their primary goal: completing tasks.\n- **Poor User Experience:** Slow, unresponsive, or non-intuitive interfaces lead to frustration and abandonment of the tool.\n- **Lack of Accessibility:** Many applications fail to meet basic accessibility standards, excluding a portion of the potential user base.\n- **Data Silos:** Applications that do not sync reliably across devices or work offline create a lack of trust in the system.\n\n### Opportunity size and market context\nThe productivity and task management market is substantial, with established players like Todoist and Microsoft To Do demonstrating clear user demand. However, there is a persistent opportunity for a product that strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and power. By focusing on a core, polished experience built on modern web standards, we can capture users who are frustrated with the complexity of market leaders or the limitations of more basic tools.\n\n## 4. Market Research & Competitive Analysis\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use research insights extensively in this section**\n\n### Industry Trends\nThe task management landscape is evolving with several key trends:\n- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):** Users expect applications to work offline and provide a native-like experience. Our architecture will be built with this in mind for future enhancement.\n- **AI-Powered Features:** While out of scope for the MVP, competitors are exploring AI for task prioritization. This represents a future differentiation opportunity.\n- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Team-based task management is a growing segment. Our initial focus is on the individual user, but the architecture should not preclude future collaboration features.\n- **Accessibility (a11y):** There is an increased industry and regulatory focus on inclusive design. Adhering to WCAG guidelines is not just a compliance issue but a market differentiator.\n\n### Competitive Landscape\n- **Todoist:** A market leader known for its robust feature set, cross-platform availability, and numerous integrations. Its complexity can be a drawback for users seeking simplicity.\n- **Microsoft To Do:** Benefits from deep integration with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, making it a default for enterprise users. Its design and web experience can feel less modern than dedicated apps.\n- **Things 3:** Praised for its award-winning design and user experience within the Apple ecosystem. Its exclusivity is a limitation for cross-platform users.\n- **Google Tasks:** Offers a very simple, no-frills experience with tight integration into Gmail and Google Calendar. It is often seen as too basic for power users.\n\n### Market Opportunities\nThe market opportunity lies in the gap between the overly complex (Todoist) and overly basic (Google Tasks) offerings. We can differentiate by providing a clean, intuitive, and fast web application that includes essential features like filtering and a best-in-class user experience, built on modern, open web technologies.\n\n### Best Practices\nBased on industry analysis, we will adopt the following best practices:\n- Implement a **component-based architecture** to create reusable UI elements (e.g., `TaskItem`, `AddTaskForm`).\n- Use a **centralized state management solution** (e.g., React Context, useReducer) for predictable state handling.\n- Design a **RESTful API** with clear endpoints (e.g., `GET /tasks`, `POST /tasks`) for the Node.js backend.\n- Incorporate **automated testing** (unit and integration tests) using frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library.\n- Ensure the application is **responsive** and provides a seamless experience across devices.\n\n### Technical Standards\nWe will adhere to the following technical standards to ensure quality and future-proofing:\n- **ES6+ JavaScript:** Utilize modern syntax such as async/await, destructuring, and arrow functions.\n- **React Hooks:** Adopt hooks (useState, useEffect) as the standard for managing state and side effects in functional components.\n- **JSON API:** Use JSON as the standard data format for communication between the frontend and backend.\n- **Semantic HTML5:** Use HTML5 tags correctly (e.g., `<main>`, `<section>`, `<button>`) to improve accessibility and SEO.\n- **Express.js:** Leverage this standard, minimalist web framework for building the Node.js API.\n\n### User Expectations\nModern users expect:\n- A **fast and responsive user interface** with immediate visual feedback for actions.\n- An **intuitive and clutter-free design** that makes task management quick and effortless.\n- **Reliable data synchronization** and persistence.\n- **Offline access** to view and manage tasks, with changes syncing once a connection is re-established.\n- **Clear and simple filtering options** to view tasks by status.\n\n### Regulatory Landscape\n- **Data Privacy:** We will implement a clear privacy policy and ensure user data is handled securely, keeping in mind compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.\n- **Accessibility:** We will adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA) to ensure the app is usable by people with disabilities.\n\n## 5.

Use Cases\n\n### UC-001: Create New Task\n- **Actors:** User\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - The user has the application open in their web browser.\n- **Main Flow:**\n  1. The user views the main task list interface.\n  2. The user locates the input field and 'Add Task' button.\n  3. The user types a task description into the input field.\n  4. The user presses the 'Enter' key or clicks the 'Add Task' button.\n  5. The system validates that the input is not empty.\n  6. The frontend application updates the state and immediately renders the new task in the list.\n  7. The system sends an asynchronous POST request to the backend endpoint (`POST /tasks`).\n  8. The backend saves the new task to the data store and responds with the newly created task object.\n  9. The input field is cleared.\n- **Alternative Flows:**\n  - **Empty Task Submission:** The user submits an empty task. The system displays an inline validation error and makes no API call.\n  - **Offline Mode:** The user is offline. The task is added to the UI and saved in local storage. The API request is queued for when the connection is restored.\n- **Postconditions:**\n  - A new task is created and visible in the user's task list.\n  - The new task is persisted in the backend database.\n- **Priority:** High\n\n### UC-002: Mark Task as Complete\n- **Actors:** User\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - The user has at least one active task in their list.\n- **Main Flow:**\n  1. The user views a task in the list.\n  2. The user clicks the checkbox associated with the task.\n  3. The system updates the task's status in the frontend state to 'completed'.\n  4. The UI immediately updates: the task text receives a strikethrough style.\n  5. The system sends an asynchronous PATCH request to the backend endpoint (`PATCH /tasks/:id`) with the new status.\n  6. The backend updates the task's status and responds with a success status.\n- **Alternative Flows:**\n  - **Un-marking a Task:** The user clicks the checkbox of a completed task, reverting its status to 'active' and removing the strikethrough. A PATCH request is sent to update the status.\n- **Postconditions:**\n  - The task's status is updated in the UI and persisted in the backend.\n- **Priority:** High\n\n### UC-003: Delete a Task\n- **Actors:** User\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - The user has at least one task in their list.\n- **Main Flow:**\n  1. The user locates the task they wish to delete.\n  2. The user clicks the 'delete' button/icon associated with the task.\n  3. The system sends an asynchronous DELETE request to the backend endpoint (`DELETE /tasks/:id`).\n  4. The backend removes the task from the data store and responds with a success status.\n  5. The UI removes the task from the list, with a fade-out animation.\n- **Alternative Flows:**\n  - **Deletion Failure:** The backend returns an error. The UI displays a non-disruptive error message, and the task remains in the list.\n- **Postconditions:**\n  - The task is removed from the UI and permanently deleted from the backend database.\n- **Priority:** High\n\n### UC-004: Filter Tasks by Status\n- **Actors:** User\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - The user has at least one task in their list.\n- **Main Flow:**\n  1. The user views the task filter controls ('All', 'Active', 'Completed').\n  2. The user clicks on one of the filter options.\n  3. The frontend updates the filter state.\n  4. The UI re-renders the task list, showing only tasks that match the selected filter.\n  5. The selected filter button is visually highlighted.\n- **Alternative Flows:**\n  - **No Tasks Match Filter:** The user selects a filter that has no matching tasks. The UI displays an empty state message (e.g., 'No active tasks').\n- **Postconditions:**\n  - The task list is filtered according to the selected status.\n- **Priority:** Medium\n\n## 8.

Technical Architecture\n\n### System Components\n- **Frontend:** A single-page application (SPA) built with React.\n- **Backend:** A RESTful API server built with Node.js and the Express.js framework.\n- **Database:** A NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) or SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) database for data persistence. (Final choice to be confirmed).\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Frontend:** React 18+, React Hooks, CSS Modules or a styled-components library.\n- **Backend:** Node.js (LTS), Express.js, a database driver (e.g., Mongoose or Sequelize).\n- **Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library.\n- **Deployment:** A cloud platform like Vercel (for frontend) and Heroku/AWS (for backend).\n\n### Integration Points and APIs\nThe frontend will communicate with the backend via a RESTful API.\n- `GET /tasks`: Retrieve all tasks for the user.\n- `POST /tasks`: Create a new task. Request body: `{ \"description\": \"string\" }`.\n- `PATCH /tasks/:id`: Update a task's status. Request body: `{ \"status\": \"completed\" | \"active\" }`.\n- `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Delete a specific task.\n\n### Data Flow and Storage\n1.  **User Action:** User interacts with a React component.\n2.  **State Update:** Component dispatches an action to update the local React state (using `useReducer` or Context API), providing immediate UI feedback.\n3.  **API Call:** An asynchronous API call is made to the Node.js backend.\n4.  **Backend Logic:** The Express.js server receives the request, validates it, and interacts with the database.\n5.  **Database Operation:** The database performs the requested CRUD operation.\n6.  **Response:** The backend sends a JSON response back to the frontend.\n7.  **Final State Update:** The frontend receives the response and updates the global state if necessary, ensuring the UI and server are in sync.\n\n### Deployment Architecture\nThe frontend and backend will be deployed as separate services. The frontend will be a static asset deployment, and the backend will be a stateful service connected to a managed database instance.\n\n## 11.

Problem Statement</h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-problem-are-we-solving\">What problem are we solving?</h3>\n<p>In an increasingly digital world, individuals and professionals struggle to manage their daily tasks and responsibilities effectively. Many existing solutions are either overly complex with a steep learning curve, part of a larger expensive ecosystem, or too simplistic and lack essential features like filtering and reliable data persistence. This leads to decreased productivity, mental clutter, and a reliance on less efficient methods like paper notes or unstructured digital documents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-has-this-problem\">Who has this problem?</h3>\n<p>This problem is universal, affecting students, professionals, freelancers, and anyone looking to organize their personal or work-related activities. Our primary target user is the \"busy professional\" who needs a fast, reliable, and distraction-free tool to manage their workflow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"current-pain-points-and-limitations\">Current pain points and limitations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cognitive Overload:</strong> Feature-heavy applications like some competitors can distract users from their primary goal: completing tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Poor User Experience:</strong> Slow, unresponsive, or non-intuitive interfaces lead to frustration and abandonment of the tool.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Accessibility:</strong> Many applications fail to meet basic accessibility standards, excluding a portion of the potential user base.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Silos:</strong> Applications that do not sync reliably across devices or work offline create a lack of trust in the system.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"opportunity-size-and-market-context\">Opportunity size and market context</h3>\n<p>The productivity and task management market is substantial, with established players like Todoist and Microsoft To Do demonstrating clear user demand. However, there is a persistent opportunity for a product that strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and power. By focusing on a core, polished experience built on modern web standards, we can capture users who are frustrated with the complexity of market leaders or the limitations of more basic tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-market-research-competitive-analysis\">4. Market Research &amp; Competitive Analysis</h2>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: Use research insights extensively in this section</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"industry-trends\">Industry Trends</h3>\n<p>The task management landscape is evolving with several key trends:\n- <strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):</strong> Users expect applications to work offline and provide a native-like experience. Our architecture will be built with this in mind for future enhancement.\n- <strong>AI-Powered Features:</strong> While out of scope for the MVP, competitors are exploring AI for task prioritization. This represents a future differentiation opportunity.\n- <strong>Real-Time Collaboration:</strong> Team-based task management is a growing segment. Our initial focus is on the individual user, but the architecture should not preclude future collaboration features.\n- <strong>Accessibility (a11y):</strong> There is an increased industry and regulatory focus on inclusive design. Adhering to WCAG guidelines is not just a compliance issue but a market differentiator.</p>\n<h3 id=\"competitive-landscape\">Competitive Landscape</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Todoist:</strong> A market leader known for its robust feature set, cross-platform availability, and numerous integrations. Its complexity can be a drawback for users seeking simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Microsoft To Do:</strong> Benefits from deep integration with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, making it a default for enterprise users. Its design and web experience can feel less modern than dedicated apps.</li>\n<li><strong>Things 3:</strong> Praised for its award-winning design and user experience within the Apple ecosystem. Its exclusivity is a limitation for cross-platform users.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Tasks:</strong> Offers a very simple, no-frills experience with tight integration into Gmail and Google Calendar. It is often seen as too basic for power users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"market-opportunities\">Market Opportunities</h3>\n<p>The market opportunity lies in the gap between the overly complex (Todoist) and overly basic (Google Tasks) offerings. We can differentiate by providing a clean, intuitive, and fast web application that includes essential features like filtering and a best-in-class user experience, built on modern, open web technologies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"best-practices\">Best Practices</h3>\n<p>Based on industry analysis, we will adopt the following best practices:\n- Implement a <strong>component-based architecture</strong> to create reusable UI elements (e.g., <code>TaskItem</code>, <code>AddTaskForm</code>).\n- Use a <strong>centralized state management solution</strong> (e.g., React Context, useReducer) for predictable state handling.\n- Design a <strong>RESTful API</strong> with clear endpoints (e.g., <code>GET /tasks</code>, <code>POST /tasks</code>) for the Node.js backend.\n- Incorporate <strong>automated testing</strong> (unit and integration tests) using frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library.\n- Ensure the application is <strong>responsive</strong> and provides a seamless experience across devices.</p>\n<h3 id=\"technical-standards\">Technical Standards</h3>\n<p>We will adhere to the following technical standards to ensure quality and future-proofing:\n- <strong>ES6+ JavaScript:</strong> Utilize modern syntax such as async/await, destructuring, and arrow functions.\n- <strong>React Hooks:</strong> Adopt hooks (useState, useEffect) as the standard for managing state and side effects in functional components.\n- <strong>JSON API:</strong> Use JSON as the standard data format for communication between the frontend and backend.\n- <strong>Semantic HTML5:</strong> Use HTML5 tags correctly (e.g., <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>) to improve accessibility and SEO.\n- <strong>Express.js:</strong> Leverage this standard, minimalist web framework for building the Node.js API.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-expectations\">User Expectations</h3>\n<p>Modern users expect:\n- A <strong>fast and responsive user interface</strong> with immediate visual feedback for actions.\n- An <strong>intuitive and clutter-free design</strong> that makes task management quick and effortless.\n- <strong>Reliable data synchronization</strong> and persistence.\n- <strong>Offline access</strong> to view and manage tasks, with changes syncing once a connection is re-established.\n- <strong>Clear and simple filtering options</strong> to view tasks by status.</p>\n<h3 id=\"regulatory-landscape\">Regulatory Landscape</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> We will implement a clear privacy policy and ensure user data is handled securely, keeping in mind compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> We will adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA) to ensure the app is usable by people with disabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"5-user-personas-stakeholders\">5.

Our solution is a sleek, responsive web application designed to provide an intuitive user experience while establishing a robust and scalable technical foundation for your future product roadmap. By leveraging a React and Node.js technology stack, we will deliver a fully functional, tested, and deployed application within your budget and timeline.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Benefits &amp; Value Proposition:</strong>\n*   <strong>Speed to Market:</strong> Launch a validated, market-ready MVP in just 4 weeks.\n*   <strong>Scalable Architecture:</strong> Build on a modern, maintainable codebase designed for future enhancements like AI-powered features and real-time collaboration.\n*   <strong>User-Centric Design:</strong> Deliver an experience that meets and exceeds modern user expectations, drawing insights from market leaders like Todoist and Microsoft To Do.\n*   <strong>Total Investment:</strong> <strong>$20,000</strong>\n*   <strong>Project Timeline:</strong> <strong>4 Weeks</strong> from kickoff to go-live.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>1. Solution Overview</h2>\n<h3>Problem Statement</h3>\n<p>In a competitive digital landscape, businesses need to quickly validate product ideas with a high-quality MVP. The challenge lies in delivering a core feature set that is both robust enough to gather meaningful user feedback and built on an architecture that won't require a complete rebuild for future iterations. A generic, off-the-shelf solution fails to provide the unique technical foundation and customization required for long-term success.</p>\n<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>\n<p>AICOE will design and build a custom-branded, web-based Todo List application. This application will serve as a powerful tool for users to manage their tasks effectively and, more importantly, as a strategic asset for your business. The focus will be on clean code, responsive design, and a seamless user experience, ensuring the product is both immediately useful and primed for future growth.</p>\n<h3>Key Features and Capabilities</h3>\n<p>Based on the prioritized use cases, the MVP will include:\n*   <strong>Task Creation (UC-001):</strong> A frictionless interface for adding new tasks with instant UI feedback and backend persistence.\n*   <strong>Task Completion (UC-002):</strong> Intuitive checkbox interaction to mark tasks as complete, providing users with a clear sense of progress.\n*   <strong>Task Deletion (UC-003):</strong> A simple and clear mechanism for users to remove tasks and keep their lists organized.\n*   <strong>Task Filtering (UC-004):</strong> Essential functionality for users to view tasks by status (All, Active, Completed), enhancing usability as lists grow.\n*   <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> A mobile-first approach ensuring a flawless experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n*   <strong>Accessibility (a11y):</strong> Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities, aligning with modern industry best practices.</p>\n<h3>Technology Stack</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React 18 with a component-based architecture and modern state management (Context API/useReducer).</li>\n<li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js with Express.js for a fast, scalable RESTful API.</li>\n<li><strong>Database:</strong> MongoDB for flexible, schema-less data storage, ideal for an evolving product.</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment &amp; Infrastructure:</strong> Hosted on a reliable cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Vercel) with CI/CD pipelines for efficient updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>2. Scope of Work</h2>\n<h3>Deliverables Breakdown</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Fully Functional Web Application:</strong> A production-ready Todo List MVP deployed to a live URL.</li>\n<li><strong>Source Code Repository:</strong> Complete, well-documented, and version-controlled source code hosted in a private Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).</li>\n<li><strong>Technical Documentation:</strong> Including API documentation, setup instructions, and an architectural overview.</li>\n<li><strong>Project Management &amp; Reporting:</strong> Weekly progress reports and access to a project management board (e.g., Jira, Trello).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Included Services</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>UI/UX Design (wireframing and mockups)</li>\n<li>Frontend &amp; Backend Development</li>\n<li>Database Design and Implementation</li>\n<li>Quality Assurance &amp; Testing</li>\n<li>DevOps &amp; Deployment</li>\n<li>Project Management</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exclusions (Out of Scope)</h3>\n<p>To ensure we meet the 4-week timeline and budget, the following features are excluded from this MVP phase and are proposed for future iterations:\n*   User Authentication and Authorization\n*   Real-time Collaboration (shared lists)\n*   AI-powered task prioritization or scheduling\n*   Native Mobile Application (iOS/Android)\n*   Advanced features like due dates, tags, or sub-tasks</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>3.

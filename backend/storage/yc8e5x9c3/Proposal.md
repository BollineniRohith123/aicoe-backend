## 1. Solution Overview

### Problem Statement
In a competitive digital landscape, businesses need to quickly validate product ideas with a high-quality MVP. The challenge lies in delivering a core feature set that is both robust enough to gather meaningful user feedback and built on an architecture that won't require a complete rebuild for future iterations. A generic, off-the-shelf solution fails to provide the unique technical foundation and customization required for long-term success.

### Proposed Solution
AICOE will design and build a custom-branded, web-based Todo List application. This application will serve as a powerful tool for users to manage their tasks effectively and, more importantly, as a strategic asset for your business. The focus will be on clean code, responsive design, and a seamless user experience, ensuring the product is both immediately useful and primed for future growth.

### Key Features and Capabilities
Based on the prioritized use cases, the MVP will include:
*   **Task Creation (UC-001):** A frictionless interface for adding new tasks with instant UI feedback and backend persistence.
*   **Task Completion (UC-002):** Intuitive checkbox interaction to mark tasks as complete, providing users with a clear sense of progress.
*   **Task Deletion (UC-003):** A simple and clear mechanism for users to remove tasks and keep their lists organized.
*   **Task Filtering (UC-004):** Essential functionality for users to view tasks by status (All, Active, Completed), enhancing usability as lists grow.
*   **Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensuring a flawless experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Accessibility (a11y):** Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities, aligning with modern industry best practices.

### Technology Stack
*   **Frontend:** React 18 with a component-based architecture and modern state management (Context API/useReducer).
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for a fast, scalable RESTful API.
*   **Database:** MongoDB for flexible, schema-less data storage, ideal for an evolving product.
*   **Deployment & Infrastructure:** Hosted on a reliable cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Vercel) with CI/CD pipelines for efficient updates.

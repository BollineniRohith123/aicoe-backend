Meeting Recording - Product Brainstorming Session
Date: January 15, 2025
Attendees: Sarah (PM), Mike (Tech Lead), Jessica (Designer), Tom (Marketing)

[00:00:15] Sarah: Okay everyone, let's get started. So, um, we're here to discuss the new fitness app idea. Mike, can you hear me?

[00:00:22] Mike: Yeah, yeah I'm here. Sorry, was on mute. 

[00:00:25] Sarah: No worries. So, the main idea is we want to build something that helps people track their workouts but also... wait, Jessica, are you there?

[00:00:32] Jessica: Yes! Sorry, my camera isn't working today.

[00:00:35] Sarah: That's fine. Okay so where was I... right, so we want to track workouts, nutrition, maybe sleep? I don't know, what do you guys think?

[00:00:45] Tom: I think sleep tracking is huge right now. Everyone's doing it. Whoop, Oura Ring, Apple Watch...

[00:00:52] Mike: Yeah but do we really want to compete with Apple? I mean, they have like unlimited resources.

[00:00:58] Sarah: Good point. Maybe we focus on something more specific? Like, what if we target people who are just starting their fitness journey? Not the hardcore athletes.

[00:01:10] Jessica: Oh I love that! Like a beginner-friendly app. We could make it super simple, not overwhelming with all these metrics and graphs.

[00:01:18] Tom: Yeah, and we could do like... oh wait, sorry, my dog is barking. One sec.

[00:01:25] Sarah: No problem. So, beginner-friendly. What features would that include?

[00:01:32] Mike: Well, definitely workout tracking. Like, they can log what exercises they did, how many reps, sets, that kind of thing.

[00:01:40] Jessica: And we should have pre-made workout plans! Like "Beginner 30-Day Challenge" or something. So they don't have to figure it out themselves.

[00:01:50] Sarah: Yes! That's perfect. And maybe we could have video demonstrations? So they know they're doing the exercises correctly?

[00:02:00] Mike: Video hosting is expensive though. We'd need to think about infrastructure costs. Maybe we start with images and GIFs?

[00:02:08] Tom: Or we could partner with fitness influencers who already have YouTube channels? Just link to their videos?

[00:02:15] Sarah: Hmm, that could work for MVP. Okay, so we have workout tracking, pre-made plans, exercise demonstrations. What about nutrition?

[00:02:25] Jessica: Nutrition is tricky. There are so many apps already doing that. MyFitnessPal, Lose It...

[00:02:32] Mike: What if we do something simpler? Like, instead of calorie counting, we just have them take photos of their meals?

[00:02:40] Tom: Oh yeah, and we could use AI to analyze the photos! Like, "Hey, you're eating a lot of carbs, maybe add more protein?"

[00:02:48] Sarah: I like that. It's less tedious than logging every single thing. But would the AI be accurate?

[00:02:55] Mike: We could use existing APIs. There are services that do food recognition. We'd just need to integrate them.

[00:03:05] Jessica: And we could make it fun! Like, give them badges for eating healthy meals. Gamification!

[00:03:12] Tom: Yes! Gamification is key. People love collecting badges and achievements.

[00:03:18] Sarah: Okay, so meal photo tracking with AI analysis and gamification. What else?

[00:03:25] Mike: Progress tracking. They need to see how far they've come. Like before/after photos, weight tracking, measurements.

[00:03:35] Jessica: And we should make the progress visualization really beautiful. Not just boring charts. Maybe like a journey map or something visual?

[00:03:45] Tom: Yeah, and we could have social features! Like, share your progress with friends, join challenges together.

[00:03:52] Sarah: Social features are good but also risky. We'd need moderation, privacy controls...

[00:04:00] Mike: Let's keep it simple for V1. Maybe just the ability to share progress privately with a few friends?

[00:04:08] Sarah: Agreed. Okay, let me try to summarize what we have so far... wait, Tom, you're frozen.

[00:04:15] Tom: Can you hear me? Hello?

[00:04:18] Sarah: You're back. Okay, so features: workout tracking, pre-made workout plans, exercise demos, meal photo tracking with AI, progress visualization, basic social sharing. Am I missing anything?

[00:04:30] Jessica: What about reminders and notifications? Like, "Hey, you haven't logged a workout in 3 days!"

[00:04:38] Mike: Yeah, push notifications are important. But we need to be careful not to be annoying.

[00:04:45] Tom: Right, like make them customizable. Some people want daily reminders, some people don't want any.

[00:04:52] Sarah: Good point. Customizable notifications. What about integrations? Should we integrate with Apple Health, Google Fit?

[00:05:02] Mike: Definitely. That's table stakes. People expect their fitness apps to sync with their health platforms.

[00:05:10] Jessica: And maybe Strava? For people who run or bike?

[00:05:15] Mike: Strava integration would be cool but might be overkill for beginners. Let's focus on Apple Health and Google Fit first.

[00:05:25] Sarah: Okay. Now, let's talk about monetization. How do we make money from this?

[00:05:32] Tom: Freemium model? Basic features are free, premium features require subscription?

[00:05:40] Jessica: What would be premium? Like, the pre-made workout plans could be premium?

[00:05:48] Mike: Or we could have a free plan with limited workout plans, and premium unlocks all of them plus personalized plans.

[00:05:58] Sarah: I like that. And maybe premium also gets advanced analytics? Like detailed progress reports, trends over time?

[00:06:08] Tom: Yeah, and we could do like $9.99/month or $79.99/year. That's pretty standard for fitness apps.

[00:06:18] Sarah: Sounds reasonable. What about the tech stack? Mike, what are you thinking?

[00:06:25] Mike: For mobile, I'd say React Native so we can do iOS and Android with one codebase. Backend could be Node.js with PostgreSQL for the database.

[00:06:38] Jessica: What about the AI for food recognition? Is that hard to implement?

[00:06:45] Mike: Not really. We can use something like Clarifai or Google Cloud Vision API. They have pre-trained models for food recognition.

[00:06:55] Sarah: And for hosting? AWS?

[00:07:00] Mike: Yeah, AWS is solid. We could use EC2 for the backend, S3 for image storage, RDS for the database.

[00:07:10] Tom: What about costs? Do we have a budget estimate?

[00:07:15] Mike: Rough estimate... development would be like 6 months with a team of 4-5 people. So maybe $300K-$400K for development. Then ongoing costs for hosting, APIs, maybe $2K-$5K per month depending on user volume.

[00:07:35] Sarah: Okay, that's helpful. And timeline? When could we launch?

[00:07:42] Mike: If we start now, we could have an MVP in 3-4 months. Then another 2 months for testing and polish. So maybe 6 months total?

[00:07:55] Jessica: That seems aggressive. What if we run into issues?

[00:08:02] Mike: Fair point. Let's say 6-8 months to be safe.

[00:08:08] Sarah: Alright. And who's our target audience exactly? We said beginners, but can we be more specific?

[00:08:18] Tom: I'm thinking people aged 25-45, probably more women than men, who want to get healthier but feel intimidated by traditional gyms and fitness apps.

[00:08:30] Jessica: Yeah, and maybe people who've tried fitness apps before but gave up because they were too complicated?

[00:08:38] Sarah: Good. So our value proposition is: a simple, beginner-friendly fitness app that doesn't overwhelm you with data and makes getting healthy feel achievable.

[00:08:50] Tom: I like that. We should emphasize the simplicity and encouragement aspect in our marketing.

[00:08:58] Mike: One more thing - should we have a web version or just mobile?

[00:09:05] Sarah: I think mobile-first makes sense. People use their phones for fitness tracking. We can add a web dashboard later if there's demand.

[00:09:15] Jessica: Agreed. Mobile is where the action is.

[00:09:20] Sarah: Okay, I think we have a good foundation here. Let me recap: We're building a beginner-friendly fitness app with workout tracking, pre-made plans, meal photo tracking with AI, progress visualization, and basic social features. Freemium model, $9.99/month for premium. React Native for mobile, Node.js backend, AWS hosting. Target audience is 25-45 year olds who want to get healthier but find traditional fitness apps overwhelming. Timeline is 6-8 months. Does that sound right?

[00:09:55] Mike: Yep, that's a good summary.

[00:09:58] Jessica: Sounds good to me!

[00:10:00] Tom: Let's do it!

[00:10:02] Sarah: Great! I'll put together a more formal PRD based on this discussion and we can review it next week. Thanks everyone!

[00:10:10] Mike: Thanks Sarah!

[00:10:12] Jessica: Bye everyone!

[00:10:14] Tom: See you all next week!
